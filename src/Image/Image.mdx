# Image

A component that takes an endpoint from American Public Media's internal image API and turns it into a valid `<img />` or `<amp-img />` object with a `srcset` and proper sizing. It can also be given a `srcset` and/or `src` manually via the fallback props.

TODO: Explain a bit of the logic of the component, how it decides which aspect ratio it should use depending on the root data and what the CMS user specified at time of creation.

## Props

### image

A JSON endpoint from APM's Image API. If formatted as expected, this component will create the src, srcset, sizes, alt text, and so on and allow you to select the aspectRatio with a single phrase.

### aspectRatio

Allows you to select one of the aspect ratios provided in the image endpoint. Can only be used if the **image** property is provided. Accepts one of the following strings:

* normal
* square
* thumbnail
* widescreen
* portrait
* uncropped

### fallbackSrcSet

Accepts a string with a srcset and overrides any srcset generated with the **image** prop (if applicable). 

### fallbackSrc

Accepts a string with a URL and overrides any src set by the **image** prop (if applicable). 

### alt

Accepts a string and overrides any alt phrase set by the **image** prop (if applicable).

### sizes

Accepts a string and overrides any size attribute set by the **image** prop (if applicable).
