# AmpImage

A component for displaying an image for AMP html, primarily from APM's image API. It pretty much works the same as the regular [`<Image />`]('/image') component, but it will hard set the width and height of the image to 400 and 225 if it can't find that info any other way, since AMP requires those properties.

We include one inline style with the AMP Image because it's hard to think of a single scenario where we wouldn't want the `maxWidth` of the image to be `100%`, and it's a bit baffling that the visual breaks by default.

TODO: explain more of this logic, where it differs from Image, where necessary.

## Props

### image

A JSON endpoint from APM's Image API. If formatted as expected, this component will create the src, srcset, sizes, alt text, and so on and allow you to select the aspectRatio with a single phrase.

### aspectRatio

Allows you to select one of the aspect ratios provided in the image endpoint. Can only be used if the **image** property is provided. Accepts one of the following strings:

- normal
- square
- thumbnail
- widescreen
- portrait
- uncropped

### fallbackSrcSet

Accepts a string with a srcset and overrides any srcset generated with the **image** prop (if applicable).

### fallbackSrc

Accepts a string with a URL and overrides any src set by the **image** prop (if applicable).

### alt

Accepts a string and overrides any alt phrase set by the **image** prop (if applicable).

### sizes

Accepts a string and overrides any size attribute set by the **image** prop (if applicable).
